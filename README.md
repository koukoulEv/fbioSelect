# A two stage variable selection algorithm for high dimensional repeated measures data 

<<<<<<< HEAD
This repository includes an R package implementing the two-stage biomarker selection algorithm used in the work "A regularized functional regression model enabling transcriptome-wide dosage-dependent association study of cancer drug response" by E. Koukouli, D. Wang, F. Dondelinger and J. Park (2020).

There is also available a sample code example which analyses a small part of the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer data (https://www.cancerrxgene.org/gdsc1000/GDSC1000_WebResources/Home.html).
